## Features

- **Per-provider proxy selection.** User can switch from ESPN+ to NHL.TV streams without having to play with a VPN.
- **Direct streams.** Streams are fetch directly from ESPN+ and NHL.TV servers and played in original quality (up to 720p60).

## Troubleshooting

**Unable to start a stream**

- If you are trying to play an ESPN+ stream, you must either be located in the US or specify a US proxy in the addon settings.
- If you are trying to play an NHL.TV stream, you must either be located in one of the [supported countries](https://nhl-support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5584014279324-NHL-TV) or specify a proxy from one of them in the addon settings.

**ESPN streams stop after a few minutes**

- If you are using a proxy for both ESPN and NHL66, try removing the proxy for NHL66 while keeping the ESPN one. Some proxy providers seem to block requests after too many reconnects.
